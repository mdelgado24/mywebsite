	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>Hello! My name is Melissa Delgado, I am 24 years old and  live in Roselle, Illinois. Currently, I'm working at Apple as a Technical Specialist, helping customers solve different product issues that may arise.
	</p>

	<p> I've collaborated on two projects under the same leadership during my time at Northeastern Illinois University. As well as taking lead in smaller groups during the development of the project. </p>

	<p>I was introduced into the world of UI/UX when my professor saw my passion for wanting to be able to use my Computer Science degree to use technology to help others.</p>

	<p>I am very passionate about helping others as much as I possibly can! My main career goal is to leave a positive imprint in the technology field and show others how it can be a valuable resource in their everyday lives.</p>
