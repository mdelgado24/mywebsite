				<p>The first project I have ever been apart of consisted of aiming to develop a mhealth application with an iterative co-design approach that would aid those who have gone or are going through the transition of in-person rehabilitation to community living and have newly acquired a disability. We hoped for this app to have a positive impact on our users and make their transition much easier.

		<p>I've had the opportunity to do amazing work alongisde professor Adler, here is some insight on what I got to accomplish:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Along with our team we conducted two zoom workshops with our peer navigators (whom would be the ones helping survivors with their transition) who would provide a lot of good insight on what should be part of the app.</li>

			<li>After the first workshop we were provided with a  sample sheet as to how the peer navigators wanted the goals section of the application to be designed.</li>
			
			<li>I was assigned a part of the project in which the cancer survivor alongside their peer navigator would be able to input their goals and check them off according to whether they accomplished them or not.</li>

		</ul>

			<p>Below you will see the first low fidelity prototype which I created on the left using Miro along with the sample sheet that was provided to us from the hour zoom call.</p>

	<section id="workshop2">At our second workshop the goal was to receive feedback on the design that was created throughout the entire project. There were a couple concerns that were brought up during that time which included the following: 
	<ul> 
		<li> whether a photo would take place or an icon they choose would.
		</li>
		<li>whether adding extra documentation would be secure in the app.
		</li>
		<li>Character limit on each goal as well as having edits and having a version history</li>
		<li>Text enlargemnet</li>
		<li>Voice input option instead of typing when putting goals in.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Future work would entail a lot of improvements as well as a two hour workshop, usability testing, a high fidelity prototype, ensure the users privacy and a full implemenation using Figma.</p>
	<p>Below is part of the project that was asigned to me to change based off feedback. As you can see changes were made such as adding color, making it intuitive on creating goals, allowing for edits as well as marking off steps taken to reach that goal. Feedback that was taken into account when redoing these designs before presenting it again.</p>

		<p>Below is a before and after of a section of the app called Connect to Peers in which the peer navigator would be able to follow up on mulitple mentees through one single page. On the right is the goals page, with improvements such as bigger fonts, bolder colors and a status change for when goals are being added.</p>

	We worked on the prototype heavily during Summer of 2023. In which we would all come togeter as a team and then present to each other what we had. While leading a small group during the summer I was in charge of the goals section as a whole to make sure flow was smooth and any changes that could be made would be made. Through this work I became knowledgable with using Figma. Collaborating with others showed me new sides to figma I did not know existed and now I can pass that knowledge onto others.

	<p>Below I have provided a video of how the protoype works through the goals section in which I had worked on throughout my time on the team.</p>
